## Adding CDN

There're lots of ways how you can use bootstrap, but
the simplest one is using CDN

<br>

Bassically we just need to add the CSS and Javascript CDN.

#### note:

javascript bundle is for things like modals, pop overs, accordions, etc

<br>

### Downside of using CDN

- you can't customize the bootstrap css
  (if you want, you can download the bootstrap files)

#### note:

When you download the bootstrap, you don't want the compiled css, you want the [source files]

<br>
This is gonna give you all the bootstrap sass file.
<br>
Sass is a css pre-compiler/precompiler that is allowing you to edit
these bootstrap variables.
